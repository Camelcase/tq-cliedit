# tq-cliedit
simple cli based editor for Titan quest(popular arpg) save files.
it can handle 2 character directories. the second is of course for the custom map characters.
i was sick and tired of the windows ui based one cause i am a linus user so i wanted something that works natively,
i also didnt need a lot of the fancy features.
so use it on YOUR OWN RISK, NO WARRANTIES AT ALL.

it can
  - safe main stashes to files
  - give any char about 2 billion gold
  - safe waypoint data to files
  - load waypoint and stash files back into main characters

requirements:
  - ruby v > 3.0
  - titan quest with save games on local machine
  - config file adjusted to tq character folders

tested on titanquest on linux, ragnarok and atlantis extension
so use it on YOUR OWN RISK, NO WARRANTIES AT ALL.
